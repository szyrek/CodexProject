# Test Project Feature

This feature introduces an example Python project used to verify Codex
workflows. It includes:

- A small calculator library with a command line interface.
- Example tasks under `example_project/tasks/`.
- Unit and end-to-end tests demonstrating expected behaviour.

The project allows experimentation with Codex automation without touching
production code.

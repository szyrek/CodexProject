# Fast Guidance

This file distills the core practices for quick reference.

## Workflow Essentials
- Read the current folder's `README.md` and `AGENTS.md` along with their parents.
- Document planned work before coding.
- Write tests first and aim for at least 60% coverage.
- Run the available test suites and ensure they pass.
- Use Conventional Commit style: `feat:`, `fix:`, or `chore:` and reference doc/feature or doc/bugfix folders.
- Skim doc/bugfix for context when planning new features.
- Update documentation and tests whenever behavior changes.

## UI Guidelines
- Keep interfaces simple and consistent.
- Provide feedback and ensure accessibility.

# Commit Message Guidelines

We use a simplified **Conventional Commits** style to make history easy to scan.
Start messages with one of the following types:

- `feat:` for a new feature
- `fix:` for a bug fix
- `chore:` for maintenance, refactoring or documentation

Use the imperative mood and keep the summary under 72 characters:
`feat: add user login`

Reference the related folder in the body when applicable, for example
`doc/feature/login` or `doc/bugfix/drag-bodies`.

All contributors and agents must follow these rules. If a change touches a
feature or bugfix folder, mention it so future debugging can trace the commit
easily.

For the wider workflow see [CODING_RULES.md](CODING_RULES.md).

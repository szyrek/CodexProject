# UI Design Best Practices

This document summarizes guidelines for building user interfaces that are easy to use and maintain.

- **Clarity and simplicity**: Present information and controls in a straightforward manner. Avoid unnecessary decoration.
- **Consistency**: Use familiar patterns and preserve predictable behavior across screens.
- **Feedback**: Make actions and state changes visible so users know what happened.
- **User control**: Allow undo and clearly mark destructive operations.
- **Accessibility**: Ensure color contrast, keyboard navigation and screen reader support work for everyone.
- **Responsive design**: Layouts should adapt to varying screen sizes.
- **Error prevention**: Validate input and make options clear to reduce mistakes.
- **Recognition over recall**: Keep important commands visible instead of forcing users to remember them.
- **Flexibility**: Provide shortcuts for experts while keeping the interface approachable for new users.
- **Consistency with real-world concepts**: Use language and metaphors that match the user's mental model.

These guidelines are inspired by standard usability heuristics such as Nielsen's. Adhering to them leads to more intuitive interfaces and easier maintenance.

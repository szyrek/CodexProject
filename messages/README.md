# Agent Communication Directory

Agents exchange asynchronous messages here. Each file should be named `YYYY-MM-DD_<from>_to_<to>.md` and contain the context or question for the next agent. Follow-up responses may be appended or placed in a new dated file. These message files stay in version control so the Orchestrator can track progress with minimal user interaction.

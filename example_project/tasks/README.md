# Sample Codex Tasks

This folder contains example tasks used to verify that Codex can execute simple
changes end-to-end. Each task describes a modification that Codex should
implement automatically.

- `add_subtract_task.md` requests the creation of a `subtract` function and tests.
- `add_power_task.md` requests the addition of a `power` function and tests.

These tasks are intentionally small so they can be executed quickly when
evaluating Codex behaviour.
